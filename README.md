**CI/CD Workflow**

This repository uses GitHub Actions with a self-hosted runner to automate testing, building, and deployment.

**Backend CI (Current Workflow)**

Trigger: Runs on every push to the main branch.

Steps:

* Checkout code from GitHub.
* Set up Node.js (v22).
* Install dependencies for both backend (./backend) and frontend (./frontend).
* Run backend tests (npm test).
* Build frontend using Yarn.
* Set environment variables from GitHub Secrets.
* Restart services using pm2.

**Deployment**

Deployment happens automatically on the self-hosted server after successful tests.
The workflow creates/updates a .env file and restarts all processes with pm2.
